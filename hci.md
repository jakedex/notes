# HCI Lab Notes

## My Keepon
 * [https://github.com/hariharsubramanyam/arduino_ros_led_keepon_control](https://github.com/hariharsubramanyam/arduino_ros_led_keepon_control)
 
## Kinova
* Supported on ROS
* Should work w/ Gazebo

## ROS - rviz issues
* [Blocked on install](http://answers.ros.org/question/202319/blocked-on-the-install-tutorial-naoqi_driver-not-found/)
* [Possible help](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ros-sig-aldebaran/9fRy1nPS0jA)

## Perlin Noise
* Really good blog post explaination: [here](http://flafla2.github.io/2014/08/09/perlinnoise.html)

## Time/Findings/Misc
* Not much ROS support for Keepon, could look into that repo, though
* Using MoveIt/integration with Perlin
* Went ahead and installed MoveIt, looks like it's used freq with Gazebo... and should help me get acclimated w/ actual Nao, simulation, etc
