# Lecture 2 (1.23.17)

### Existence & Contingency

Novelist is explorer of existence — not study of past

- Everything that is could not have been

- Anything can happen at any moment => existence is not only a fact, but a possibility

"Existence is the realm of human possibilities"
  - everything that man can become

### 1984

Was exploring inherent potentialities in the first part of the 20th century
  - a possible future from the lens of the present

### "An experimental self"

"... it [a character] is a imaginary being. An experimental self."

A character is not a simulation of a living being, it's an imaginary being

Imagination is the detour thanks to which the novelist approaches reality

### Novel as a Cure

"... one sided nature of the European sciences, which reduced everything to a mere object of technical and mathematical investigation and the put the concrete world of life, ... beyond the horizon"

Human life cannot be quantified — not possible to measure your freedom

This is a world of the immeasurable

Novel brilliance: "Wisdom of the uncertainty"

Contradictory truths embodied in imaginary selves called characters

### Jacques the Fatalist

"Where are they going" => "Does anyone really know 'where they're going'?"

Novel opens the world of uncertainty

Good novelists are able to recreate the world

### Don Quixote (1605)

novel by Miquel de Cervantes, considered the Spanish bible

We don't know if the character believes the realities of his own life

"Unbelievable absurdities" of Don Quixote
  - "Do not enter into the calculations of factual truth", "[Don Quixote] only has to make use of mimesis (representation of the real world in literature) in the writing"

Cervantes doesn't want to tell the truth about actual reality — uses mimesis to destroy the factual truth

Wants us to believe and at the same time not believe in the realities of the character

Mimesis: The representation/the imitation of reality in literature and art

His vision always is at least double

A part of DQ's body is in reality, the other part in fiction

### Final

"the problem with novels is not that they don't tell us the truth, the problem is that we are never sure when they do it"
