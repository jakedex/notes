## Russell-Einstein Manifesto

to "all powerful governments of the world",
  - in opposition to nuclear weapons

## Manifesto

= clear, clearly visible, obvious

two things must be clear:
  - analysis of situation
  - necessity for a radical shift

Convince reader of radical shift

turns impossible into reality

seemingly always target something impossible and tries to change it

wanting to be the immediate literary embodiment of something that didn't exist but might exist in the future
  - possible to see this ideal, to express them that shows that it's possible

every radical manifesto needs to be a literary manifesto to start things out

## Surrealism

fight against our representation of reality

it is perhaps childhood that comes closest to one's real life

existence is elsewhere

the surreal is a manifesto, written to help the reader reach this true world of dreams

surrealist art doesn't try to describe what it is, only to imagaine what it's not — the impossible
