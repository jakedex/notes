Imperialism mean the practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory; colonialism, which is almost walys a consequence of imperialism, is the implanting of settlements on distant territory
Edward Said

## Equivalence

Conrad neither believes in the cultural superiority of the colonialist nations, nor rejects colonialism outright. The message of HoD is that Western civilization is at base as barbarous as african society — a viewpoint which disturbs imperialist assumtptions to the precise degree that it reinforces them
Terry Eagleton

## Ahead of his time & Creature of his time

Ahead in that he records illusions of imperialism and colonialism

Creature as he can't take the next step, which would be to recognize that the non-european darkness was in fact a non-european world resisting imperialism

## Beyond and Against Ideology

HoD isn't only literature (said product)— it's also an ideological product

but it's not only an ideological product, it's also a cure against any kind of ideological product

we don't know who the true narrator is, or what they believe

The recording eye of Conrad's anonymous narrator function in the same way as the camera funcitons in a film.

it's a ghost watching the film
