### Memory

#### Address Space

Each process has a set of addresses

Has static and dynamic components

Why do processes need dynamic allocation of memory?
  - Don't know amount of memory needed at compile time
  - Must be pessimistic when allocating memory statically
    - Allocate enough for worst possible case

Recursive procedures: Don't know how many times procedure will be called

#### Stack Organization

Memory must be freed in opposite order from allocation

Simple and efficient implementation: Pointer separates allocated and freed space
  - alloc: increment pointer
  - free: decrement pointer

No fragmentation

#### Memory Access

```c
int x;
x = x + 3;
```

```
0x10: movl 0x8(%rbp), %edi // move contents of x into reg
0x13: addl $0x3, %edi // add 3
0x19: movl %edi, 0x8(%rbp) // move back into x
```

5 memory accesses: one for each instr fetch
  - Fetch instruction at addr 0x10
    - load from addr 0x208
  - fetch instr at addr 0x13
    - exec

`%rbp`: base pointer
`%rip`: instr pointer

### How to Virtualize Memory

#### 1) Time Sharing of Memory

Similar to how OS virtualizes CPU
  - OS gives illusion of many virtual CPUs by saving CPU registers to memory when not in use
  - Could copy memory out to disk

Problem: Ridiculously slow

Let's try space sharing

#### 2) Static Relocation

OS rewrites each program before loading it as a process in memory

Each rewrite for different processes uses different addresses and pointers

Change jumps, loads of static data

Problems:
  - No protection: Processes can destroy OS or other processes, no privacy
  - Cannot move address space after it has been placed: may not be able to allocate new process

#### 3) Dynamic Relocation: Base

Protects processes from one another

Requires hardware support
  - MMU: dynamically changes process addr at every memory reference
    - process genereates logical or virtual addresses
    - memory hardware uses physical or real addresses

Has two modes:
  - User mode: perform translation of logical addr to phyiscal

Implementation:
  logical addr -> [mode ?] user ? addr += base : phys

      virtual    | physical
P1: load 100, R1 | load 1124, R1
P2: load 100, R1 | load 4196, R1

hardware handles the translation

No protection for protecting other registers when using dynamic relocation

#### 4) Dynamic with Base+Bounds

Limit the address space with a bounds register

Base register: smallest phyiscal addr

Bounds register: size of this processes virtual addr space (largest physical addr)

Implementation:
  logical addr -> [mode ?] user ? ()< bounds ? addr += base : trap) : phys

Context-switch: need to save base and bounds registers to PCB
  - If using multiple threads, just don't change base and bound registers / addr space

Advantages:
  - Provides protection across address spaces
  - Supports dynamic relocation
  - Simple, inexpensive implementation, fast

Disadvantages:
  - Each process must be allocated contiguously in physical memory
  - No partial sharing: Cannot share limited parts of address space

#### 5) Segmentation

Divide address space into logical segments

Each segment corresponds to logical entity in address space

Designate segments by using part of logical address
  - Top bits select segment
  - Low bits select offset w/in segment

Advantages:

- Enables sparse allocation of memory

Disadvantages:

- Each segment must be allocated contiguously
  - May not have sufficient physical memory for large segments
