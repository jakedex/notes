### Virtualizing The CPU

* Goal: give each 'process' impression it alone is actively using CPU

- Resources

### What's a process

_Process_: Execution stream in the context of a process state

  - Execution stream is running piece of code, or the 'thread of control'
  - process state: everything that running code can affect or be affected by
    - Registers
    - Address space
    - Open files

### Processes == Programs?

Process is different than a program.
  - Program: Static code
  - Process:

### Processes == Thread

Process is different than a thread.

- Thread: 'Lightwweight process (LWP)'
  - Execution stream
  - Multiple threads/process

- e.g. Two processes looking at the same memory address see different values, but two threads looking at the same memory address see the same value

### CPU Virtualization

_Direct execution_: OS allows user process to run directly on CPU, creates process and transfers control to starting point
  Problems:
    - Process could do something restricted
    - Process could run forever
    - Process could do something slow (like I/O)

  Solution: Limited direct execution
    - Privilege levels supported by hardware (bit of status)
      - User mode: User process can then access devices with system calls which in turn change the mode
        - User processes not allowed to perform:
          - general memory access
          - disk IO
          - Special x86 instructions
      - Kernel mode: instruction for interacting with devices and memory
    - OS requirements for multiprogramming
      - Mechanism: to switch between processes
      - Policy: to decide when/which to switch to
    - Switches between processes with varying states

### Dispatch Mechanism

OS runs _dispatch loop_, i.e. run process A for some time-slice, context switch to process B

- Q: How does dispatcher get control?
  - 1. Cooperative Multi-tasking: trust process to relinquish CPI to OS through traps
    - Problems: Processes can misbehave, take over machine, making reboot the only solution
    - Not used in modern OSs
  - 2. True Multi-tasking: Guarantee OS can obtain control periodically
    - Enter OS by enabling periodic alarm clock
      - Hardware generates timer interrupt
    - Dispatcher counts interrupts between context switches

- What context must be saved?
  - Dispatcher saves context in process control blocks (PCB)
    - Execution state (registers, PC, stack ptr, frame ptr)
    - PID
    - Process state (running, ready, or blocked)
    - Scheduling priority
    - Accounting information (child/parent processes)
    - Credentials
    - Pointers to other allocated resources (open files)
  - Requires special hardware support
    - Hardware saves process PC and PCB

### Slow Ops Such as IO

- When running process performs op that doesn't use CPU, OS switches to process that needs CPU
  - OS must track mode of each process
    - Running: on the CPU
    - Ready: Waiting for the CPU
    - Blocked: Asleep, waiting for IO or sync to complete

- OS must track every process in system
- OS maintains queues of all processes
