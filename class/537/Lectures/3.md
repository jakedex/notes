# Lecture 3 Notes

## Process Creation

Two options: create new process, or clone existing and change

### Clone existing process and change
-e.g. `fork()` and `exec()`

`fork()`
  - Clones calling process

`exec()`
  - Clones calling process

Pros: Flexible, clean, simple
Cons: Wasteful to perform copy and then overwrite memory

(These are how Unix shells are implemented)

## Scheduling

_Workload_: set of job descriptions
  - Job is current CPU burst of a process

_Scheduler_: logic that decides which ready job to run

_Metrics_: measurement of scheduling quality
  - Minimize turnaround time (Tcompletion - Tarrival)
  - Minimize response time (Tinitial_schedule - Tarrival)
  - Maximize throughput (jobs completed / second)
  - Maximize resource utilization (% time CPU busy)
  - Minimize overhead (# context switches and resulting in cache misses)
  - Maximize fairness (variation of CPU time across jobs)

##### Workload Assumptions

1. Jobs run for the same amount of time
2. Jobs arrive at the same time
3. Runtime of each job is known

#### Non-preemptive Schedulers

_FIFO_: First In, First Out (aka FCFS - first come first served)
  - runs jobs in arrival time order
  - avg. turnaround time: (10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 20
  - works poorly when first task is extremely long (Convoy effect)

Now let's remove assumption that they run for the same amount of time

_SJF_: Shortest Job First
  - Somehow knows the time of each process and runs the shortest first
  - avg. turnaround time: (10 + 20 + 80) / 3 = 36.667 (vs. 70 w/ FIFO)
  - for minimizing avg turnaround time SJF is probably optimal (if CPU burst lengths are known)

Now let's remove assumption that all jobs arrive at the same time

E.g. `(60 + (70 - 10) + (80 - 10))/3` : make sure to subtract off arrival time

#### Preemptive Schedulers

_Preemptive_: potentially stops running job to take preference over new one

_STCF_: Short Time to Completion First

Note that scheduler only runs ready jobs

Now let's remove the assumption that we know the runtime for each job

If jobs have same length: FIFO is fine

If jobs ave different lengths: SJF is fine

_RR_: Round Robin (alternate ready processes every fixed-length time-slice)
  - Does poorly when all jobs have the same runtimes

##### History

- Processes alternate between IO and CPU work
- Guess how CPU burst will behave based on past bursts with this process

#### MLFQ

_MLFQ_: Multi-level Feedback Queue
  - supports two job types:
    - interactive (those that want fast turnaround)
    - batch (long running)
  - Set priority with nice, or history 'feedback'

- Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs
- Rule 2: If Priority(A) == Priority(B), A & B run in RR
- Rule 3: Processes start at top priority
- Rule 4: If job uses whole slice, demote process (longer slices at lower priorities)

Problems:
  - Low priority job may never get scheduled
    - Fix by periodically boosting priority of all jobs
  - Can be gamed
    - Fix by accounting for process' total run time
