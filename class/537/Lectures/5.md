# Lecture 5 Notes (_9.20.16_)

### Fragmentation

_External_: Visible t allocator
_Internal_: Visible to requester

### Paging

Goal: Eliminate requirement that address space is contiguous
  - eliminate external Fragmentation

Divide address spaces and physical memory into fixed-sized pages

#### Translation of Page Addresses

Logical -> Physical
  - high-order bits of address designate page number
  - low-order designate offset w/in page

High
  - page # -> frame number

#### Where are Page Tables Stored

32-bit address space, 4KB pages, 4 byte PTEs
  - [20 | 12] , 2^20 pages x 4 bytes = 4MB

#### Advantages

No external Fragmentation

#### Disadvantages

- Internal fragmentation: Page size may not match size needed by process
- Additional memory reference to page table
- Storage for page tables may be substantial
