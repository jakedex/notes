# 2: Introduction to Operating Systems

#### What happens when a program runs?

-Processor fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, and executes it (Von Neumann model of computing)

OS takes physical resources and converts them into easy-to-use virtual forms.
Also provides API of system calls that are available to programs (standard library)
OS also called resource manager

### 2.2: Virtualizing Memory

Each process accesses its own private address space, which the OS somehow maps onto the physical memory of the machine

_atomically_: all at once

_file system_: software in the OS that usually manages the disk

For performance reasons, most file systems first delay writes for a while, hoping to batch them into larger groups for performance reasons.

To handle the problems of system crashes during writes, most file systems incorporate some kind of intricate write protocol, such as journaling or copy-on-write, carefully ordering writes to disk to ensure that if a failure occurs during the write sequence, the system can recover to reasonable state afterwards.

### 2.5: Design Goals

- build up abstractions
- provide high performance, i.e. minimize the overheads of the OS
- provide protection between applications, as well as between OS and applications
    - isolation is the key to protection
- provide a high degree of reliability
- energy efficiency
- security
- mobility

### 2.6: Some History

- Early Operating Systems
    - Provided a library of commonly-used functions
    - batch processing: a number of jobs were set up and then run in a batch by the operator
- Protection
    - System call was invented by the Atlas computing system
    - System call transfers control into the OS while simultaneously rating the hardware privilege level
    - User applications run in user mode
         - can't initiate IO request, access physical memory page, or send a packet on the network
    - Trap: special hardware instruction that initiates system calls
    - Trap Handler raises privilege level to kernel mode. return-from-trap instruction reverts to user mode while simultaneously passing control back to where the application left off

- Multiprogramming
    -rapidly switch back and forth between processes while OS was doing slow things like IO

- Modern Era
    -PC
