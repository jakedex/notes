# Ch. 42 Crash Consistency: FSCK and Journaling

*Crash-consistency problem*: Writing to two on-disk structures - If the system crashes or loses power after one write completes, the on-disk structure will be left in an inconsistent state

## 42.1 A Detailed Example

### Crash Scenarios

Need to perform three writes, imagine that a single write succeeds:
- Just the data block is written to disk
  - Data on the disk but no inode that points to it and no bitmap that says the block is allocated
  - Not a problem in terms of consistency
- Just the updated inode is written to disk
  - inode points to disk address that hasn't been written yet.
  - File-system inconsistency: on-disk bitmap tells us that data block 5 hasn't been allocated, but the inode says it has
- Just the updated bitmap is written to the disk
  - inconsistent again, could result in space leak as block 5 wouldn't be used by file system

Also have cases where two writes succeed.

## 42.2 Solution #1: The File System Checker

Basically, they decided to let inconsistencies happen and then fix them later (when rebooting). A classic example of this lazy approach is found in a tool that does this: `fsck`

Can't fix garbage data issue

Phases:
  - Runs before file system is mounted and made available
  - Superblock: sanity checks, attempts to find suspect superblock
  - Free blocks: scans inodes, indirect blocks, double indirect blocks, to build understanding of which blocks are allocated w/in the file system
    - Uses this to build a correct version of allocation bitmaps
  - Inode state: e/ is checked for corruption or other problems
  - Inode links: verifies link count
  - Duplicates: checks for duplicate pointers to the same block
  - Bad blocks: bad if obviously points to something outside of its valid range
  - Directory checks: assures that '.', '..' are first entries, that each inode referred to in a directory entry is allocated, and ensuring that no directory is linked to more than once in the entire hierarchy

Expensive! Takes loads of time to fix simple three block problems.

## 42.3 Solution #2: Journaling (Or Write-Ahead Logging)

Write-ahead logging (journaling): When updating the disk, before over- writing the structures in place, first write down a little note (somewhere else on the disk, in a well-known location) describing what you are about to do. Writing this note is the “write ahead” part, and we write it to a structure that we organize as a “log”

Adds a bit of work during updates but greatly reduces amount of work required in recovery

Journal is placed w/in same file system image

### Data Journaling

![](../img/42.png)

The transaction begin (TxB) tells us about this update, including information about the pending update to the file system (e.g., the final addresses of the blocks I[v2], B[v2], and Db), as well as some kind of transaction identifier (TID).
The middle three blocks just contain the exact contents of the blocks themselves

*Checkpointing*: bring it up to date w/ the pending update in the journal)

To assure that no issues occur when writing journal, file system issues transactional write
  - Journal write: Writes all blocks except the TxE block to the journal, issuing these writes all at once
  - Journal commit: When these writes complete, TxE is then written, leaving the journal in its final, safe state.
