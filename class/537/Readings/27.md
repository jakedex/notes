# Ch. 27: Interlude - Thread API

### 27.1: Thread Creation


```
pthread_create(thread, attr, (*start_routine)(void*), arg)
```

`thread` is pointer to structure that we use to interact with this thread

`attr` used to specify any attributes this thread might have (stack size, scheduling priority, etc)

`(*start_routine)(void*)` function pointer

`arg` argument to be passed to the function where the thread begins execution

### 27.2: Thread Completion

```
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
```

`thread` which thread to wait For

`**value_ptr` pointer to return value you expect to get back

### 27.3: Locks

```
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```

Critical sections of code should the wrapped with the above procedures

If no other thread holds the lock when `pthread_mutex_lock` is called, the thread will acquire the lock and enter the critical section

If another thread does hold the lock, the thread trying to grab the lock won't return until it has acquired the lock

#### Initializing locks

```
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
```

During run time:
```
int rc = pthread_mutex_init(&lock, NULL);
assert(rc == 0); // always check success!
```

Must also call the function below when done w/ the lock
```
pthread mutex destroy()
```

### 27.4: Condition Variables

Used when some kind of signaling must take place between threads, if one thread is waiting for another to do something before it can continue.

```
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
// puts the calling thread to sleep, thus waits for some other thread to signal it
// usually when something in the program has changed that the sleeping thread may care about
```

One has to have a lock that's associated with this condition, when calling either of the above routines, this lock should be held.

#### To wake a thread:
```
Pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
ready = 1;
Pthread_cond_signal(&cond);
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```

When signaling, always be sure to have the lock held in order to reduce race conditions.

Waking thread gets lock up wake and until return
