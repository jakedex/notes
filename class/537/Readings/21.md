# Ch. 21: Beyond Physical Memory: Mechanisms

_Memory Overlays_: A requirement of old systems to move code/data in/out of memory as needed.

Swap space allows the OS to support the illusion of a large virtual memory for multiple, concurrent processes.

### 21.1: Swap Space

Space reserved on disk for moving pages back and forth.

### 21.2: The Present Bit

Present bit indicates whether the corresponding PTE is in physical memory or not

_Page Fault_: Accessing a page that's not in physical memory
  - Page fault handler runs and services the page fault, as elaborated upon below

### 21.3: The Page Fault

Software handles page falts

OS can use bits in PTE (e.g. PFN) to look for page on disk

### 21.4: What If Memory's Full?

### 21.5: Page Fault Control Flow

Case: Page both present and valid -> TLB can grab PFN from PTE
Case: Page valid, not present
Case: Invalid, not present -> Hardware traps invalid access, trap handler runs

### When Replacements Really Occur

OS has some kind of _high watermark_ and _low watermark_

Once fewer than LW pages available, background thread (swap daemon) frees pages until there are HW pages available
