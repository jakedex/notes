# Ch. 47 Distributed Systems

## 47.1 Communication Basics

Packet arrives at a router, must be placed somewhere in memory in order to be processed. If all arrive at once, the memory of the router cannot accomodate all of the packets - thus the only choice it has it to drop one or more of the packets.
  - Same problem occurs at end hosts as well

## Unreliable Communication Layers

*UDP* a process uses the sockets API in order to create a communication endpoint; applications then send datagrams to UDP endpoint
  - employs a checksum to detect some forms of packet corruption

Checksum: Sum of the bytes of a chunk of data

## 47.3 Reliable Communication Layers

*Acknowledgement (ack)*: Receiver sends short message back to its sender

To handle case where sender doesn't receive ack, a _timeout_ is set to retry sending

Need to guarantee that each message is received exactly once by the receiver
When the receiver sees a duplicate transmission, it simply acks the message, but (critically) does not pass the message to the application that receives the data

To detect duplicate messages, we use a mechanism known as a *sequence counter*
  - Sender and receiver aggree upon start value for a counter that each side will maintain
  - When message is sent, current value of the counter is sent along w/ the message
  - If the ack is lost, the sender will timeout and re-send the message, because the receivers counter has already incremented, it knows that it's already received this message

TCP is the most commonly used reliable communication layer.

## 47.4 Communication Abstractions

*Distributed Shared Memory*: systems enable processes on different machines to share a large, virtual address space.
  - Implemented in virtual memory: when page fault occurs, handler sends a message to some other machine to fetch the page
  - Issues because it can't handle failure properly
  - expensive page faults and fetches from other machines

## 47.5 Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

Makes the process of executing code on a remote machine as simple and straight-forward as calling a local function.

### Stub Generator

Removes some of the pain of packing function arguments and results into messages by automating it.

Takes set of calls servers wishes to export to clients:
```c
 interface {
         int func1(int arg1);
         int func2(int arg1, int arg2);
};
```

Then generates the *client stub* (contains each of the functions specified in the interface)

Code in client stub does this:
  1. Create message buffer
  2. (Marshaling of arguments, serialization of the message) Pack needed information into message buffer (identifier for the function to be called, as well as all of the args that the function needs)
  3. Send the message to the destination RPC server
  4. Wait for the reply (sychronous)
  5. Unpack and return code and other arguments (Unmarshaling, deserialization)
  6. Return to the caller

Thread pool: Finite set of threads are created when server starts, when a message arrives, it is dispatched to one of these worker threads

### Run-Time Library

By building a request/response protocol (such as RPC) on top of a reliable communication layer, two “extra” messages are sent

Uses unreliable communication layer (e.g. UDP), and takes care of the responsibility of reliability to the RPC system itself (timeout/retry and acks)

Byte ordering:
  - Big endian: stores bytes from most significant to least
  - Little endian: stores bytes from least to most significant

^ Handle the communication between machines of different endianness by providing well-defined endianness in their message formats
