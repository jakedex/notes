# Ch. 49 The Andrew File System

Main goal was scale - designed such that a server can support as many clients as possible

## 49.1 AFS Version 1

Whole-file caching on the local disk of the client machine that's accessing a file

read, write will access local copy

will flush back to server on close if changes were made

NFS caches blocks, AFS files
NFS caches in memory, AFS local disk (after client reads/writes on local it's caches in memory)

Subsequent requests to the server for a file will check contact server to determine if the file has changed. If not, client uses local copy

Key issues:
  - Path traversal took too long
  - Servers receiving too many TestAuth messages

## 49.4 AFS Version 2

Introduced callback to reduced number of client/server interactions. This added state to the server, but now the client no longer needs to contact the serer to find out if a cached file is still valid.

File identifier (FID) instead of pathnames to specify which file a client was interested in
  - volume id
  - file id
  - unqiquifier (enable reused of volume and file IDs whne a file is deleted)

FID allows client to walk the pathname, caching the results and reducing the load on the server

## 49.5 Cache Consistency

Between different machines, AFS makes updates visible at the server and invalidates cached copies at the exact same time, which is when the updated file is closed. A client opens a file, and then writes to it (perhaps repeatedly). When it is finally closed, the new file is flushed to the server (and thus visibile); the server then breaks callbacks for any clients with cached copies, thus ensuring that clients will no longer read stale copies of the file; subsequent opens on those clients will require a re-fetch of the new version of the file from the server

Last writer wins: in the case that processes on different machines are modifying a file at the same time, the last client that calls close last will update the entire file on the server last and will thus be the 'winning' file

## 49.6 Crash Recovery

In the case that the server can't contact the client, the client's cache will be treated as suspect - upon client's next access to any of these files, client assk the server whether its cached copy is still valid

In the case of a server crash, each client must realize that the server has crashed and treat the contents of their cache as suspect.
  - to alert of a crash, clients use heartbeat, or can send out message to clients
