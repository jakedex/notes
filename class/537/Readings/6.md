# Ch. 6: Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution

### 6.1: Limited Direct Execution

Just run the program directly on the CPU

### 6.2: Problem #1: Restricted Operations

_Trap Table_: set when machine boots; when the machine boots up, it does so in a privileged mode.

One of the first things the OS thus does is to tell the hardware what code to run when certain exceptional events occur (trap handlers)

Procedure calls like `open()` are simply wrappers for system calls that do use trap underneath

### 6.3: Switching Between Processes

Cooperative Approach: wait for system calls, OS trusts the processes of the system to periodically give up the CPU so that the OS can decide to run some other task

Non-Cooperative Approach: OS takes control
     - Timer interrupt raises an interrupt every X ms; when raised, current process is halted and interrupt handle in the OS runs

Saving and Restoring Context

Scheduler decides whether to continue running the currently-running process, or switch to a different one
     -if switch, OS executes context switch
