# Ch. 5: Interlude: Process API

### 5.1: The fork() System Call

Used to create a new process. Spawns a new child process from the moment called.

### 5.2: Adding `wait()` System Call

The `wait()` system call tells the parent to wait for a child process to finish and then returns to the parent.

### 5.3: Finally, the `exec()` System Call

Useful for when you was to run a program that's different than the calling program

Given the name of san executable, and some arguments, it takes the code from that executable and overwrites its current code segment with it

Doesn't create a new process, simply transforms currently running program into a different running program

### 5.4: Why? Motivating the API
