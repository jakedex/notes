# Ch. 29: Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures

Adding locks to a dat structure to make it usable by threads makes the structure *thread safe*

### 29.1: Concurrent Counters

*Perfect Scaling*: threads complete just as quickly on multiple processors as the single thread does on one.

#### Scalable Counting

*Sloppy Counter*: works by representing a single logical counter via numerous local physical counters, one per CPU core, as well as a single global counter.
  - When thread running on given core wishes to increment the counter, it increments its local counter. The global counter is kept up to date by updating periodically.

threshold 'S', sloppiness, determines how often we update the global counter

### 29.2: Concurrent Linked Lists

Only when updating the linked list does the lock need to be held

#### Scaling Linked Lists

*hand-over-hand locking*: (aka lock coupling), instead of having a single lock for the entire list, you instead add a lock per node of the list. When traversing the list, the code first grabs the next node’s lock and then releases the current node’s lock
  - speed gains from enabling concurrency not worth overhead. need hybrid approach

### 29.3: Concurrent Queues

Two locks - one for head of the queue, and one for the tail; this enables concurrency for enqueue and dequeue operations

### 29.4: Concurrent Hash Table

Focus on simple hash table that doesn't resize

Lock per hash bucket
