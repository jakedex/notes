# Ch. 9: Scheduling: Proportional Share

Scheduler tries to guarantee that each job obtain a certain percentage of CPU time

_Lottery Scheduling_: every so often, hold a lottery to determine which process should get to run next; processes that should run more often should be given more chances to win the lottery.

### 9.1: Basic Concept: Tickets Represent Your Share

Tickets represent the share of a resource that a process should receive

### 9.2: Ticket Mechanisms

_Ticket currency_: allows a user with a set of tickets to allocate tickets among their own jobs in whatever currency they would like; the system then automatically converts said currency into the correct global value

_Ticket transfer_: process can temporarily hand off its tickets to another process

_Ticket inflation_: a process can temporarily raise or lower the number of tickets it owns

### 9.3: Implementation

Linked list of jobs/tickets, generate random number, iterate list (summing tickets), stop when sum > rand

### 9.6: Why Not Deterministic?

_Stride scheduling_: Each job in the system has a stride, which is inverse in proportion to the number of tickets it has

Each time a process runs, we will increment a counter for it (it's pass value) by its stride to track global progress. Pick the process to run that has the lowest pass value so far.

Problem: has global state.
