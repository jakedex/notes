# Ch.4: The Abstraction: The Process

_Time Sharing_: By allowing the rescue to be used for a little while by one entity, and then a little while by another, and so further the resource can be shared by many.

_Space Sharing_: counterpart to time sharing, where resource is divided (in space) amount those who wish to use it.

_Mechanisms_; mechanisms are low-level methods or protocols that implement a needed piece of functionality.
     -answer 'how' questions

Policies are algorithms for making some kind of decision within the OS (high-level intelligence)
     - answer 'which' questions

### 4.1: The Abstraction: A Process

_Process_: The abstraction provided by the OS of a running program.

_Machine state_: what a program can read or update when it's running. At any given time, what parts of the machine are important to the execution of this program?
     -memory (address space)
     -registers (Program counter, stack pointer, frame pointer)

### 4.2: Process API

- Create
- Destroy
- Wait
- Miscellaneous Control
- Status

### 4.3: Process States

- Running
- Ready
- Blocked

Ready -> Running (scheduled)
Running -> Ready (descheuled)

### 4.4: Data Structures

_Process Control Block (PCB)_: individual structure that stores information about a process
_Register context_: holds, for a stopped process, the contents of its register state

_Zombie state_: has been exited but not cleaned up
