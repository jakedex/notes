# Ch. 31: Semaphores

### 31.1: Semaphores - A Definition

A semaphore is an object with an integer value that we can manipulate with two routines; in the POSIX standard, these routines are `sem_wait()` and `sem_post()`

```
#include <semaphore.h>
sem_t s;
sem_init(&s, 0, 1);
```

`sem_wait()`  will either return right away (because the value of the semaphore was one or higher when we called it), or it will cause the caller to suspend execution waiting for a subsequent post. decrement the value of semaphore s by one, wait if value of semaphore s is negative

`sem_post()` simply increments the value of the semaphore, and then, if there is a thread waiting to be woken, wakes one of them up.

value of the semaphore, when negative, is equal to the number of waiting threads (typically not seen)

### 31.2: Binary Semaphores (Locks)

Locks only have two states - starts at 1, thread 0's sed_wait call decr to 0, any other threads will then wait until thread 0 calls sem_post

### 31.3: Semaphores as Condition Variable

Start at 0

### 31.4: Producer/Consumer (Bounded Buffer) Problem

(// TODO)

### 31.5: Reader-Writer Locks

Allows for many concurrent reads (lookups) to occur as long as we can guantantee no insert is on-going

Have `readlock` and `writelock`

Upon assigning first readlock, write lock is also taken - all readers must finish before the write lock can be acquired

Note that this has flaws in fairness - it's fairly simple to hog the write lock

Don't add much of a performance boost, add more overhead

### 31.6: The Dining Philosophers

Philosophers, forks, want to prevent deadlock. Solution, have e.g. p=4 grab in different order
