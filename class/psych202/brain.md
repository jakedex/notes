### The stuff of the brain

-   Nerve cells (Neurons)

-   Glial cells

-   Types of neurons

    -   Sensory neurons - afferent

    -   Motor neurons - efferent

    -   Interneurons

-   Structure of the neuron

    -   Dendrites

    -   Cell body

    -   Axon

-   Structure of the neuron

-   Neuronal Communication

    -   Chemicals produce changes in the cell’s electrical potential

    -   Electrical changes in the cell result in the release of
        chemicals

-   Neuron at Rest

    -   Ions flow across the cell membrane at different rates

    -   Difference in flow leads to a higher concentration of negatively
        charged ions inside the cell

    -   Implication - the cell is polarized

    -   Resting Potential

-   Postsynaptic Potentials (PSP)

-   Voltage change at a receptor site on a postsynaptic cell membrane

    -   Increase or Decrease the probability of an action potential in
        the receiving cell

    -   Excitatory PSP

        -   Depolarizes

    -   Inhibitory PSP

        -   Hyperpolarizes

-   Threshold

-   Action Potential: Voltage spike

    -   Cell membrane becomes temporarily permeable - (Na+ ions rush in)

    -   Brief change in the electrical charge

    -   The cell is depolarized (inside becomes positively charged)

-   The Action Potential - the neuron fires

    -   All-or-none principle

-   Propagation of the action potential

    -   Action potential is regenerated down the length of the axon

    -   The cell quickly restores itself

-   Repolarization

    -   Sodium-potassium pump

-   Refractory Period

    -   “down time” typically only 1 - 2 ms

    -   Can be created by drugs such as novocaine

    -   closes the Na + channels in sensory neurons that would otherwise
        send pain signals to the brain

-   Propagation of the action potential - The role of myelin

    -   Nodes of Ranvier

    -   Saltatory conduction

-   Structure of the neuron

-   Neuronal Communication - The electrical part

    -   Resting potential

    -   Inhibitory and Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials (IPSP’s
        & EPSP’s)

    -   Axon hillock

    -   The Action Potential - the neuron fires

    -   Triggers the release of neurotransmitter

-   Communication Between Neurons

-   Synapses: The Junctions Between Neurons

    -   Neurons DO NOT touch each other

    -   Sherrington - synapse

    -   The impulse must travel across the synapse

    -   Loewi - Chemical messengers

-   Neurotransmitters

-   Structure of the synapse

-   Modifying the process

    -   Agonists

    -   Serotonin (5-HT)

    -   GABA

    -   Glutamate

    -   Endorphins

-   The Nervous System

    -   Central Nervous System (CNS)

        -   Brain and Spinal Cord

    -   Peripheral Nervous System

        -   Somatic nervous system -senses and muscles

        -   Autonomic nervous system -internal organs

            -   Sympathetic nervous system -activates

            -   Parasympathetic nervous system - calms

-   How do we learn about brain function?

    -   Case studies - examination of brain damaged individuals
