# Chapter 1: Psychology, The Evolution of a Science

Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

Mind refers to our private inner experience, the ever-flowing stream of consciousness that is made of per- ceptions, thoughts, memories, and feelings

Behavior refers to observable actions of human beings and nonhuman animals, the things that we do in the world, by ourselves or with others

_Plato_ argued in favor of nativism, which maintains that certain kinds of knowledge are innate or inborn

_Philosophical empiricism_: all knowledge is acquired through experience (Aristotle)

_phrenology_ (Gall), which held that specific mental abilities and characteristics, ranging from memory to the capacity for happiness, are localized in specific regions of the brain

_physiology_, which is the study of biologi- cal processes, especially in the human body

_structuralism_ (Wundt), the analysis of the basic elements that constitute the mind

_functionalism_ (James): the study of the purpose mental processes serve in enabling people to adapt to their environment

Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–93) interviewed patients who had developed a condition known then as _hysteria_, a temporary loss of cognitive or motor functions, usually as a result of emotionally upsetting experiences

According to Freud, the _unconscious_ is the part of the mind that operates outside of conscious awareness but influences conscious thoughts, feelings, and actions

_psychoanalytic theory_, an approach that emphasizes the importance of unconscious mental processes in shaping feelings, thoughts, and behaviors

_psychoanalysis_, which focuses on bringing unconscious material into conscious awareness

_cognitive psychology_, which is the sci- entific study of mental processes, including perception, thought, memory, and reasoning

### The Brian meets the Mind: The Rise of Cognitive Neuroscience

_behavioral neuro- science_, which links psychological processes to activities in the nervous system and other bodily processes

_Cognitive neuro- science_ is the field that attempts to under- stand the links between cognitive processes and brain activity

### The Adaptive Mind: The Emergence of Evolutionary Pschology

_Evolutionary psychology_ explains mind and behavior in terms of the adaptive value of abilities that are preserved over time by natural selection
