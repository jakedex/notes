# Chapter 2 Notes

_dogmatism_ to describe the tendency for people to cling to their assumptions
_empiricism_ to describe the belief that accurate knowledge can be acquired through observation

_scientific method_ is a set of principles about the appropriate relationship between ideas and evidence

_theory_, which is a hypothetical explanation of a natural phe- nomenon

_hypothesis_, which is a falsifiable prediction made by a theory

_empirical method_, which is a set of rules and techniques for observation

Humans are hard to study:
  - Complexity
  - Variability
  - Reactivity

_operational definition_, which is a description of a property in concrete, measurable terms. The operational definition of a second is “the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of cesium-133 atoms in their ground state undis- turbed by external fields” (which takes roughly six seconds just to say)

_measure_, which is a device that can detect the condition to which an operational definition refers

Good measures have the following three properties:
  - Validity: the extent to which a measurement and a property are conceptu- ally related
  - Reliability: is the tendency for a measure to produce the same measurement when- ever it is used to measure the same thing
  - Power: is the ability of a measure to detect differences

Demand characteristics are those aspects of an observational setting that cause people to behave as they think they should

_Natural observation_ is a technique for gathering information by unobtrusively observing people in their natural environments.

observer bias: expectations can influence observations

expectations can influence reality

## Explanation: Discovering Why People Do What They Do

_Natural correlations_ are those that we observe in the world around us
  - tell relationship, not what relationship

_third-variable correlation_, which means that two variables are correlated only because each is causally related to a third variable

_third-variable problem_ refers to the fact that a causal relationship between two variables cannot be inferred from the naturally occurring correlation between them because of the ever-present pos- sibility of third-variable correlation

_experiment_, which is a technique for establishing the causal relationship between variables

_manipulation_, which is the creation of an artificial pattern of variation in a variable in order to determine its causal powers

_independent variable_ The variable that is manipulated in an experiment.

_experimental group_ The group of people who are treated in a particular way, as compared to the control group, in an experiment.

_control group_ The group of people who are not treated in the particular way that the experimental group is treated in an experiment.

_dependent variable_ The variable that is measured in a study.

_self-selection_ A problem that occurs when anything about a person determines whether he or she will be included in the experimental or control group.

_random assignment_ A procedure that uses a random event to assign people to the experimental or control group.

_internal validity_ The characteristic of an experiment that establishes the causal relationship between variables.

_external validity_ A property of an experi- ment in which the variables have been operationally defined in a normal, typical, or realistic way.

When the odds that random assignment failed are less than 5%, an experimental result is said to be _statistically significant_

_case method_, which is a method of gathering scientific knowledge by studying a single individual
