# Chapter 2 Notes (2.1, 2.2, 2.6, 2.7)

## 2.1 Perspectives on Connecting

### 2.1.1 Classes of Links

All practical links rely on some sort of electromagnetic radiation propagating through a medium or, in some cases, through free space

One way to characterize links, then, is by the medium they use:
  - copper wire in some form, as in Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and coaxial cable
  - optical fiber

Frequency, measured in hertz, with which the electromagnetic waves oscillate
  - Wavelength = speed of light / wave freq

Binary data is encoded in the signal
  - lower layer: _modulation_: varying the frequency, amplitude, or phase of the signal to effect the transmission of information

Last mile/bare-bone links:
  Dial-up 28–56 kbps
  ISDN 64–128 kbps
  DSL 128 kbps–100 Mbps
  CATV (cable TV) 1–40 Mbps
  FTTH (fibre to the home) 50 Mbps–1 Gbp

Local area networks (LANs)
  - Ethernet
  - 802.11

## 2.2 Encoding (NRZ, NRZI, MANCHESTER, 4B/5B)

We ignore the details of modulation and assume we are working with two discrete signals: high and low. In practice, these signals might correspond to two different voltages on a copper-based link or two different power levels on an optical link

Bits flow between network adapters (that are between node + link)

**non-return to zero (NRZ)**: High -> 1, Low -> 0
  - _baseline wander_: the receiver keeps an average of the signal it has seen so far and then uses this average to distinguish between low and high signals. Whenever the signal is significantly lower than this average, the receiver concludes that it has just seen a 0; likewise, a signal that is significantly higher than the average is interpreted to be a 1. Too many consecutive 1s or 0s cause this average to change, making it more difficult to detect a significant change in the signal.
  - _clock recovery_: sender/receiver have to have same clock speed, receiver derives the clock from the received signal—the clock recovery process.

**non-return to zero inverted (NRZI)**: has the sender make a transition from the current signal to encode a 1 and stay at the current signal to encode a 0.
  - solves the problem of consecutive 1s, nothing for consecutive 0s

**Manchester encoding**: transmitting the exclusive OR of the NRZ-encoded data and the clock
  - problem: doubles the rate at which signal transitions are made on the link

**Baud rate:** The rate at which the signal changes
  - In the case of the Manchester encoding, the bit rate is half the baud rate, so the encod- ing is considered only 50% efficient

**4B/5B** (pg. 81)
- o insert extra bits into the bit stream so as to break up long sequences of 0s or 1s. Specifically, every 4 bits of actual data are encoded in a 5-bit code that is then transmitted to the receiver
- 80% efficiency
- attempts to address the inefficiency of the Manchester encoding without suffering from the problem of having extended durations of high or low signals


## 2.6 Ethernet and Multiple Access Networks

The more general name for the technology behind the Ethernet is Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD)

“carrier sense” in CSMA/CD means that all the nodes can distinguish between an idle and a busy link

“collision detect” means that a node listens as it transmits and can there- fore detect when a frame it is transmitting has interfered (collided) with a frame transmitted by another node

### 2.6.1 Phsyical Properties

Ethernet segments were originally implemented using coaxial cable of length up to 500 m

Hosts connected to an Ethernet segment by tapping into it. A transceiver, a small device directly attached to the tap, detected when the line was idle and drove the signal when the host was transmitting. It also received incoming signals. The transceiver, in turn, connected to an Ethernet adaptor, which was plugged into the host.

Multiple Ethernet segments can be joined together by _repeaters_: device that forwards signals
  - no more than four repeaters, classic ethernet had range of 2500m

hub: multiway repeater

The original Ethernet specifications used the Manchester encoding scheme described in Section 2.2, while 4B/5B encoding or the similar 8B/10B scheme is used today on higher speed Ethernets

In all cases, data trans- mitted by any one host on that Ethernet reaches all the other hosts
  - means all hosts in same collision domain

### 2.6.2 Access Protocol

_media access control (MAC)_

#### Frame format

![../img/r2.25]()

64-bit preamble allows the receiver to synchronize with the signal; it is a sequence of alternating 0s and 1s

Both the source and destination hosts are identified with a 48-bit address.

The packet type field serves as the demultiplexing key; it identifies to which of possibly many higher-level protocols this frame should be delivered.

Each frame contains up to 1500 bytes of data. Minimally, a frame must contain at least 46 bytes of data, even if this means the host has to pad the frame before transmitting it

each frame includes a 32-bit CRC

The sending adaptor attaches the preamble and CRC before transmitting, and the receiving adaptor removes them

#### Addresses

Every Ethernet host in the world— has a unique Ethernet address. Technically, the address belongs to the adaptor, not the host; it is usually burned into ROM

`8:0:2b:e4:b1:2` is the human-readable representation of Ethernet address `00001000 00000000 00101011 11100100 10110001 00000010`

Each manufacturer of Ethernet devices is allocated a different prefix that must be prepended to the address on every adaptor they build

an Ethernet address consisting of all 1s is treated as a broadcast address

multicast address: has the first bit set to 1 but is not the broadcast address

an Ethernet adaptor receives all frames and accepts:
  -  Frames addressed to its own address
  -  Frames addressed to the broadcast address
  -  Frames addressed to a multicast address, if it has been instructed to listen to that address
  -  All frames, if it has been placed in promiscuous mode

#### Transfer Algorithm

When the adaptor has a frame to send and the line is idle, it transmits the frame immediately; there is no negotiation with the other adaptors

When an adaptor has a frame to send and the line is busy, it waits for the line to go idle and then transmits immediately

_1-persistent_ protocol because an adaptor with a frame to send transmits with probability 1 whenever a busy line goes idle
  - a p-persistent algorithm transmits with probability 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 after a line becomes idle and defers with probability q = 1 − p

possible for two (or more) adaptors to begin transmitting at the same time — **collide**
  - At the moment an adaptor detects that its frame is colliding with another, it first makes sure to transmit a 32-bit jamming sequence and then stops the transmission.

_runt frame: _64-bit preamble plus 32-bit jamming sequence

Why is its length limited to only 2500 m? Why not 10 or 1000 km? The answer to both questions has to do with the fact that the farther apart two nodes are, the longer it takes for a frame sent by one to reach the other, and the network is vulnerable to a collision during this time

we need to limit the Ethernet’s maximum latency to a fairly small value (e.g., 51.2 μs) for the access algorithm to work

_exponential backoff_: Each time it tries to transmit but fails, the adaptor doubles the amount of time it waits before trying again

### 2.6.3 Experience with Ethernet

work best under lightly loaded conditions. This is because under heavy loads (typically, a utilization of over 30% is considered heavy on an Ethernet) too much of the network’s capacity is wasted by collisions

## 2.7 Wireless

_Spread spectrum_ is to spread the signal over a wider frequency band, so as to minimize the impact of interference from other devices

_frequency hopping_ is a spread spectrum technique that involves transmitting the signal over a random sequence of frequencies

_direct sequence_, adds redundancy for greater tolerance of interference

In a wireless mesh, nodes are peers; that is, there is no special base station node

## 2.7.1 802.11/ WiFi

#### Phsyical properties

802.11n provides the highest maximum data rate, topping out at 600 Mbps

802.11, 802.11b three standards all operated in the license-exempt 2.4-GHz frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum

802.11a, which deliv- ers up to 54 Mbps using a variant of FDM called _orthogonal frequency division_ multiplexing (OFDM); 802.11a runs in the license-exempt 5-GHz band

At lower bit rates, it is easier to decode transmitted signals in the presence of noise

#### Collision Avoidance

The reason why wireless nodes cannot usually transmit and receive at the same time (on the same frequency) is that the power generated by the transmitter is much higher than any received signal is likely to be and so swamps the receiving circuitry.

![../img/r2.30.png]()

exposed node problem

![../img/r2.31.png]()

802.11 addresses these problems by using CSMA/CA, where the CA stands for collision avoidance, in contrast to the collision detection of CSMA/CD used on Ethernets

RTS-CTS (Ready to Send-Clear to Send): The sender sends an RTS— a short packet—to the intended receiver, and if that packet is received successfully the receiver responds with another short packet, the CTS

#### Distribution System

802.11 calls these base stations _access points (APs)_, and they are connected to each other by a so-called distribution system
  - operates at link layer

The technique for selecting an AP is called scanning and involves the following four steps:
  1. The node sends a Probe frame.
  2. All APs within reach reply with a Probe Response frame.
  3. ThenodeselectsoneoftheaccesspointsandsendsthatAPan Association Request frame.
  4. The AP replies with an Association Response frame.

A node engages this protocol whenever it joins the network, as well as when it becomes unhappy with its current AP

### 2.7.2 Bluetooth (802.15.1)

Bluetooth operates in the license-exempt band at 2.45 GHz.

Bluetooth links have typical bandwidths around 1 to 3 Mbps and a range of about 10 m

The basic Bluetooth network configuration, called a _piconet_, consists of a master device and up to seven slave devices

Since Bluetooth operates in an license-exempt band, it is required to use a spread spectrum technique (as discussed at the start of this section) to deal with possible interference in the band. It uses frequency-hopping with 79 channels (frequencies), using each for 625 μs at a time

### 2.7.3 Cell Phone Technologies

The geographic area served by a base station’s antenna is called a cell

The cur- rent base station senses the weakening signal from the phone and gives control of the phone to whichever base station is receiving the strongest signal from it. If the phone is involved in a call at the time, the call must be transferred to the new base station in what is called a _handoff_.

As we noted above, there is not one unique standard for cellular, but rather a collection of competing technologies that support data traffic in different ways and deliver different speeds.
  - classified by generation

**CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)**: uses a form of spread spectrum to multiplex the traffic from multiple devices into a common wireless channel
  - There is no hard limit on how many users can share a piece of spectrum—you just need to make sure they all have unique chipping codes
