#### Struct
* class w/o methods, all data fields are public 
* created to organize data, convienience
* cpp class naming convention is more flexible than java, usually use capitalized classes and lowercase structs - just be consistant

#### Vectors
* like Java's arraylist, same operations, different names
* auto expanding array - so use vector over dynamically sized array
* `#include <vector>`
* can have vector of any type, including int
* `vector<int> mylist;`
