# Notes on The C Programming Language (K&R)
## Chapter 1
* Program begins executing at `main` function
* variables usually declared all at beginning
* `printf` works like in Java
* comments same as Java
* symbolic constants: `#define` line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particulat string of characters, `#define name replacement text`
* *text stream* is a sequence of characters divided into lines, each line with zero or more characters followed by a newline character
* `getchar()` reads next input character from a text stream, `putchar(c)` prints a character 
* can use `int` to store `char` 
* any assignment is an expression and has a value (value of the left hand side after the assignment)
    * `while((c = getchar()) != EOF)`
    * above parentheses are required, `!=` has higher precedence than `=`
* *null statement*, an isolated semicolon, satisfies C's requirement of for a `for` loop to have a body
* `int power(int base, int n)`
* *function prototype* is a function declaration before main
* All arguments are passed 'by value' - called function is given the values of its arguments in temp variables rather than the originals
* `\0` is the null character, whose value is 0, is placed at the end of a char array to mark the end of a string of characters
* local variables are often referred to as automatic variables, as they disappear automatically when the function is exited
* global variables often called external variables
    * must be defined outside any function
    * variable must also be declared in e function that wants to access it - explicitly with `extern int max;`
    * `extern` not need when definition of the external variable occurs in the source file before its use in a particular function
    * Traditionally, all `extern` declarations of variables and functions are placed in a separate file called a header, that is included by `#include` at the front of e/ source file (suffix .h)
    * `void` should be included in function prototypes with empty param list
* 'Definition' refers to places where the variable is created or assigned storage, 'declaration' refers to places where the nature of the variable is state but no storage is allocated
