# [JavaScript Prototype in Plain Language](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-prototype-in-plain-detailed-language/)

Every JS function has a prototype property, that's not enumerable, and is used primarily for inheritance.

The prototype attribute points to the object's parent - it's also referred to as the prototype object, and is set automatically every time you create a new object.

Object attributes are prototype, class, and extensible attributes.
